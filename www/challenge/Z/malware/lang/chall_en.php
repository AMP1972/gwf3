'This challenge consists of 6 different parts.<br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
1. Hi,<br/>
This is an <b>********</b> virus. As you know we are not so technical<br/>
advanced as in the West. We therefore ask you to delete all your<br/>
files on your harddisk manually and send this email to all your<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
2. When you see &quot;Dis is one half&quot; on your screen, half of your hard drive has been<br/> 
encrypted with <b>***</b> encryption.<br/>
<br/>
3.  <b>**** ****</b> is a great DNS technique for botherders to avoid shutting down of their<br/> 
malware or phishing site and to hide these sites with an ever-changing network of compromised hosts<br/> 
acting as proxies.<br/>
<br/>
4. Download the source code for netsky.ae (variant name by Kaspersky), in the main.cpp<br/> 
(sha-256sum=e80d5db98e3e661bee9e57e0e524de2b97db2f48c63f2e73c562719501aeddc1) <br/>
the first host name in the 90. row is www.<b>******</b>.com<br/> 
<br/>
5. After downloading and installing Trojan-PSW.Win32.Sinowal.w (variant name by Kaspersky)<br/>
(sha-256sum=c21ae31e700930b02ad8c286c098770a1baad33abae6436733bb024998bdd19e), <br/>
first the malware queries the DNS for r<b>******</b>.com (include r in the final answer).<br/>
<br/>
6. Download Trojan-GameThief.Win32.Nilage.mc (variant name by Kaspersky)<br/>
(sha-256sum=d2243520460811f14c7f77dce093b807e546298b6eb3e8d8a8f4581f28057284),<br/> 
unpack and analyze. The executable contains the string: c:\<b>******</b>.txt <br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
Your task is to fill in the * parts, concatenate the answers with _ (underscore) and remove any spaces (if any).<br/>   
To be more precise, the solution string will contain 5 _ and alltogether 43 characters.<br/>
You only have to answer 5 out of the 6 questions correctly to be succesfull, but please include every answer<br/> 
(even if one is known wrong).<br/>',
