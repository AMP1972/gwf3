I am using my own code (which is mostly free / bsd license compatible). The license will not change, so other people may use it as well.<br/>3) GWF2 is pretty flexible, compared to other websites or forums. To add stuff to it you mostly do not need to touch any core file. If you would need to touch a core file we put it in the core as opt-in.',
