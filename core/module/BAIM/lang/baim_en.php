'I got the idea for B.AIM while playing pool during a holiday in the Netherlands.
Because I was bored in the evenings in the hotel, I thought to myself,
write a program which calculates pool tosses and vizualize it.
I was lucky and still got Delphi7 on my laptop, so I could start coding right away.
I was curious how I could implement the physics best, and searched google for a pool simulation.
By google I found Playray, and immediately the idea of a concept.
After 5 days one hour each, the first version of B.AiM was done.
So, the program got created within a holiday, due boredom and curiousity how to realize such a project best.
The reason that Playray got chosen was a pure accident. I did not know the site before.',

Alternatively you can click View->Auto_Adjust to snap the windows autmatically. As soon as you placed the white ball, move your mouse away from the table to locate the position of the balls on table. Afterwards you can start to aim and hit balls. It is recommended to disable shadows for a better rate of scanning the balls!\r\n\r\n".
