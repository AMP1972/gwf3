Your task is simple:<br/>
Find the first two primes above 1 million, whose separate digit sums are also prime.<br/>
As example take 23, which is a prime whose digit sum, 5, is also prime.<br/>
The solution is the concatination of the two numbers,<br/>
Example: If the first number is 1,234,567<br/> 
and the second is 8,765,432,<br/>
your solution is 12345678765432<br/>
