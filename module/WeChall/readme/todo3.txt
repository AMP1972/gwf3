Kender:
- Auto updates: update the stats for all users daily (except sites that auto-update)

- admin.php: edit users
- form/forum/new_thread allow users to specify a "hidden" challenge to be applied or also regular challenge, maybe group
- show most viewed threads (enhance thread table with sorting)
- allow users to create groups ?
- profile: about me text field
- online today: maybe also show users from 2 days

- check already activated at activation/registration

quangntenemy:
- Layout: provide clear and usable layout for all pages
- Design: Improve graphics and colour schemes

All:
! case sensitivity for all nicknames !
- Code cleanup + coding conventions -
  * a /page.php should only resolve commands and userinput(INPUT) and call classes
  * Currently most methods return a message (this should change)
    htmlDisplayError() should be called within classes instead of returning messages
    ! return values are for code flow and accessability !

xmadx:
1.  fields more than 255 chars within users table in database_structure.php
2.  two entries of 'DAFAULT' in users table in database_structure.php
3.  top 10 ranking takes last 10 users.  Main Ranking takes first 10 users. (need to sort based on time achieved?)
4.  need to ensure cookies are enabled else cannot login.
5.  Bind IP checkbox is redundant.. you bind anyway.
